# 📋 Project Overview

**ScholarStream** is a full-stack, data-driven Scholarship Management System designed to bridge the gap between students seeking financial aid and global universities. It features a modern, responsive UI with **Dark/Light theme support**, secure payment processing, and role-based dashboards for Students, Moderators, and Administrators.

The platform streamlines the entire workflow: from searching and filtering scholarships to applying via **Stripe** payment and tracking application status in real-time.
